# Coffee Vending Machine
My first 100+ lines of code that represents a coffee vending machine which sells 3 drinks with different levels of sugar. It serves many customers and it makes beverages depending on the dozes of their ingredients. It also only accepts money in form of 1, 2, 5, and 10 dirhams
and returns the change in form of those coins too.
